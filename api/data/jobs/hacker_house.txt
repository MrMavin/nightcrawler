About the job
Join our Startup in a Hackerhouse in LatAm as Founding Engineer!



Team of 5 (TUM, CDTM, Manage & More, LMU) looking for a founding engineer to join in our Hackerhouse in LatAm.


Clera is a fast-growing AI start-up that is rethinking the way how top talents find their next dream jobs. We are working with some of the leading AI start-ups like Mintlify, Luminai and Windsurf. 



We believe that the recruiting process needs to be talent-first to make it easy to get in touch with those companies, be coached in the journey and actually get hired.


As we are quickly growing and see a massive tech challenge in automating the work of the $600B global headhunting industry, we are looking for a cracked founding engineer intern. You will work directly with our CTO & Co-Founder Daniel and ship your own features to production every day. You will have a strong impact on building our fully agentic system to automate the headhunting process end-to-end.


Set-up: Hacker-Houses in LatAm:
Live & build with a small founding team—think YC sprint, but sunny & adventures
Zero commute, 10× feedback loops & team bonding
Our international team flew in from Germany, Canada, Sweden, Colombia
Working on the largest talent market - the US - on the same time zone
It’s very intense but also extremely productive & fun to live and work from the same AirBnb as a team
